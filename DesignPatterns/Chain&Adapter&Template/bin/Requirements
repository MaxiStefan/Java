PleaseHelp hospital needs to implement a service for ER that would reduce the timeto filter the incoming patients
ER is using a complex decisional system to decide the gravity and the action to be taken for each patients

* if temperature < 40 => check other conditions else ask a general doctor for help
* if bleeding, the patient will go to surgical unit w/o cheking for other conditions
* if unconscious, patient will go to neurology unit
* if no major problems are found, patient will go home
-------------------Chain


The hospital has a software that queries patients about their conditions using getDescription(). Unconscious patients cannot answer however but 
the solution is already running and there are existing such patients.
Find a solution to change those existing objects by adding a new attribute (companionPersonName) and  changing how
getDescription() works. for these patients getDescription() will also indicate the companion's name
-----------------Adapter


there is a fix sequence of steps that must be taken in order for a new patient to be registered in the hotel
implement a solution that would allow this sequence to be done in either android or web interface
