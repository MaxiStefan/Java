In order to create an online game (with superheroes), you need to create a software solution that will provide

1. Efficient management of the connection to the Database / logger
- the different modules must use or link a unique connection to the database
- programmers implementing those modules cannot build multiple objects associated with the database connection
- the client must use a unique object to take care of the connection to the database

2. Instantiation of the superhero associated with the player
- there are many attributes to allow its customization
- name, is Positive, points Life, weapon Left Hand, weapon Right Hand, super Power, is Wounded Critical, super Super Power, etc.
- an efficient solution must be found that allows the creation of the superhero without giving values for all the attributes but 
also without allowing the programmers to omit some of them

3. Create different weapon types in the game
- currently there are 3 types of weapons PISTOL, MACHINE_GUN and ROCKET
- there is a risk that in the future new types will appear or the existing ones will change
- the game has 2 themes (for kids and others); the solution must allow the users to choose a theme and to get objects specific to that theme

4. All characters have a 3D graphic model
- instances of the same character can appear in the game
- creating the 3D model is an expensive process because it involves loading and generating the model
- an efficient solution must be found to create several instances of the same character
